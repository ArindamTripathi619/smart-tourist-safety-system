## üí° Immediate Priorities (This Week)

### 1. **Most Important - Get Basic Demo Working**
   - Simple user registration/login
   - Basic mobile app that shows user location
   - Simple web dashboard showing registered users
   - **Goal**: Have something to show by end of week 1

### 2. **Documentation**
   - Update README.md with project description
   - Document API endpoints as you create them
   - Keep track of setup instructions

### 3. **Version Control Best Practices**
   - Create feature branches for each major feature
   - Use meaningful commit messages
   - Regular commits and pushes

## ‚ö° Quick Wins for Demo

### For SIH Presentation, focus on these features first:
1. **User Registration with Digital ID** - Shows blockchain concept
2. **Mobile App with Map View** - Shows location tracking
3. **Panic Button** - Core safety feature
4. **Admin Dashboard** - Shows monitoring capability
5. **Basic Geo-fencing Alert** - Shows AI/ML integration

---

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't try to build everything at once** - Start with MVP
2. **Don't spend too much time on UI initially** - Focus on functionality
3. **Don't ignore version control** - Commit frequently
4. **Don't work in isolation** - Regular team sync-ups
5. **Don't forget documentation** - Document as you build

## Next Steps After Week 1

Once you have the basic infrastructure:
1. **Week 2**: Implement geo-fencing and basic AI alerts
2. **Week 3**: Add blockchain digital ID generation
3. **Week 4**: Enhanced dashboard and emergency response
4. **Week 5**: Testing and refinement
5. **Week 6**: Final presentation preparation

Remember: **Start small, build incrementally, and always have a working demo!**

Good luck with your SIH project! üéâ
