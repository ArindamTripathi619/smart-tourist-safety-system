## Problem Statement
This problem statement proposes the development of a Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System that leverages AI, Blockchain, and Geo-Fencing technologies. The system should include:

### **Digital Tourist ID Generation Platform**
- A secure blockchain-based system that issues digital IDs to tourists at entry points (airports, hotels, check-posts).  
- These IDs should include basic KYC (Aadhaar/passport), trip itinerary, and emergency contacts, and be valid only for the duration of the visit.

### **Mobile Application for Tourists**
- Auto-assign a Tourist Safety Score based on travel patterns and area sensitivity.  
- Geo-fencing alerts when tourists enter high-risk or restricted zones.  
- Panic Button with live location sharing to nearest police unit and emergency contacts.  
- Optional real-time tracking feature (opt-in) for families and law enforcement.  

### **AI-Based Anomaly Detection**
- Detect sudden location drop-offs, prolonged inactivity, or deviation from planned routes.  
- Flag missing, silent, or distress behaviour for investigations.  

### **Tourism Department & Police Dashboard**
- Real-time visualizations of tourist clusters and heat maps of high-risk zones.  
- Access to digital ID records, alert history, and last known location.  
- Automated e-FIR generation for mission person cases.  

### **IoT Integration (Optional)**
- Smart bands or tags for tourists in high-risk areas (e.g., caves, forests).  
- Continuous health/location signals and manual SOS feature.  

### **Multilingual Support**
- App and platform available in 10+ Indian languages and English.  
- Voice/text emergency access for elderly or disabled travellers.  

### **Data Privacy & Security**
- End-to-end encryption and compliance with data protection laws.  
- Blockchain ensures tamper-proof identity and travel records.  

---

## Background
In regions like the Northeast, where tourism is a key economic driver, ensuring the safety of visitors is paramount. Traditional policing and manual tracking methods are insufficient in remote and high-risk areas. There is a pressing need for a smart, technology-driven solution that ensures real-time monitoring, rapid response, and secure identity verification for tourists, while maintaining privacy and ease of travel.

---

## Expected Solution
A robust digital ecosystem comprising:
- Web portal and mobile app for tourists and authorities.  
- AI/ML models for behaviour tracking and predictive alerts.  
- Blockchain-based ID generation and verification.  
- Real-time dashboards for police/tourism departments.  
- Optional IoT wearable integration for enhanced safety.  
- Automated alert dispatch and evidence logging systems.
